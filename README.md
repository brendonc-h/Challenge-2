# Code Refactor Starter Code
Started off by making the code semantic html. Replacing all of the (div) with header, section, aside, and footer.

The CSS there was a lot of repeating code that was not needed. I cut a lot of it out and added a few attributes.

I added (alt) to the images so that if you can see the images it will come up with text.
<div id="top"></div>

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can't be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.
